Coding standards, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should follow.

# Coding Standards

- Use TypeScript best practices.
- Use `const` and `let` instead of `var`.
- use export default for the main export of a module.
- Use arrow functions for callbacks.
- Use ApiResponse<T> for API responses, server actions.

# Coding practices

- Keep components small and focused.
- Use descriptive names for variables and functions.
- Separate types in respective "types.ts" files.
- Always propose a plan before writing code, adding it to TODO.md and mark completed tasks.
- Always clean up after yourself, removing unused code and imports.
- No need to rerun pnpm dev after making changes to the code.
- Short, concise, and clear code and implementation summary is preferred.

# Tools

- use pnpm for package management.
