## Planned

- [ ] [Setting function] In setting admin can change garage info + banner image and those get displayed on the landing page.

  - [x] Garage info (name, phone, email, address) now displayed on landing page
  - [ ] Banner image functionality still needs implementation

- [ ] [Inventory report] Consider adding actual inventory additions/purchases tracking
  - [ ] Currently "Used" column shows parts used (consumption) during period
  - [ ] For complete inventory tracking, may need to add actual parts purchased/received
  - [ ] This would require adding inventory movement tracking (purchases, receipts, adjustments)
